Conclusion: 
With a RMSE value of 0.40, I was able to predict the price of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam for 2020 using linear Regression. Number of reviews and Neighborhood had maximum importance and influenced pricing. Most common amenities available are Hair Dryer, Iron, Hangers, Essentials, Shampoo, WIFI and Internet. It is important to note that free parking is not available very commonly. Hence, use public transportation instead of renting a vehicle when in Amsterdam to save some money. Most expensive accommodation is available in 1101 Zip code. Centrum-Oost and Centrum-West has the most expensive accommodation followed by Zuid and IJburg - Zeeburgereiland. Least expensive accommodations are available in Bijlmer-Oost followed by Gaasperdam – Driemond. Most properties are available in the range of 100 USD to 180 USD per night with an average of approximately 140 USD
